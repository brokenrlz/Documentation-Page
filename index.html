            Java is popular high-level, class-based object oriented programming 
            language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. 
            Currently Java is owned by Oracle and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
            Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 
            is used to develop numerious types of software applications like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobile apps</li>
            <li>Web apps</li>
            <li>Dekstop apps</li>
            <li>Games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA). This means that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>

    <p>James Gosling initiated Java language project in June 1991 for use in one of his many set-top box projects. The language, initially called 'Oak' after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by the name 'Green' 
        and ended up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words.</p>
        <p>Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.</p>
        <p>On 13 November, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

            On 8 May, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code free and open-source, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.</p>

        <p>Just to give you a little excitement about Java programming, I'm going
             to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program</p>
             
        <p>In Java, every application begins with a class definition. In the program, HelloWorld is the name of the class, and the class definition is:</p>
        <code>
            public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
        </code>
        <p>In Java, any line starting with // is a comment. Comments are intended for users reading the code to understand the intent and functionality of the program.<br>
             It is completely ignored by the Java compiler (an application that translates Java program to Java bytecode that computer can execute).</p>
        <code>
            //This will print 'Hello World' as the output
        </code>
        <p>This is the main method. Every application in Java must contain the main method. The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method.</p>
        <code>
            public static void main(String []args) {
        </code>
        <p>The code below is a print statement. It prints the text Hello World , to standard output (your screen). The text inside the quotation marks is called String in Java</p>
        <code>
            System.out.println("Hello World");
        </code>
        <p>The Output will be</p>
        <code>Hello World</code>
